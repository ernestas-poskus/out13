After reading this book `The Complete Problem Solver` by John R. Hayes* I decided
to apply newly learnt principles and share them in this blog.
I have a number of books in my shelf that are waiting in queue to read.
I will mostly apply what was in Chapter 6 'Using memory effectively'
and Chapter 7 'Learning strategies'.

I will use following memory techniques:

 - acronyms and acrostics: useful for important lists, rules
 - rhyme-key method: arbitrary lists up to 10 items
 - multiple-key method: multi digit numbers
 - method of loci: arbitrary lists or length limited
 - keyword method: vocabulary learning
 - image-name technique: learnings names of people
 - chaining: arbitrary lits

Strategies:

 - The structuring strategy
 - The context strategy
 - Monitoring
 - Inferencing
 - Instantiation
 - Multiple coding
 - Attention management

Study systems:

 - Survery Q3R
 - MURDER system
 - Jones et mastery learning system
 - Perkins knowledge as design system

Thus my own version of mnemonic major system*.

I already wrote several posts on mnemonics check them out here [/tags/mnemonics](/tags/mnemonics/).
My purpose is to learn & share ways of learning and experiences in doing so.
